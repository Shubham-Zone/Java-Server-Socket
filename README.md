# Java Networking Examples

This repository contains Java programs demonstrating various networking concepts, including server-client communication and file transfer, implemented using sockets.

## Programs Overview

1. **Server and Client**: Basic server-client communication where the client sends a message to the server and receives a response.

2. **Server2 and Client2**: Enhanced server-client interaction where both the server and client can send and receive messages continuously.

3. **File Server and File Client**: Implementation of file transfer between a server and client, where the client can request a file from the server and receive its content.

## Usage

1. Compile the Java files using any Java compiler.
2. Start the server by running the server programs (`Server.java`, `Server2.java`, or `FileServer.java`).
3. Run the client programs (`Client.java`, `Client2.java`, or `FileClient.java`) to interact with the server.
4. Follow the prompts or command-line instructions to send messages or transfer files between the server and client.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on the system.

## Usage Example

```shell
# Start the server
java Server

# Run the client
java Client
```
